## Work Summary (Developer Facing)
During this sprint, our team continued to work on the document exporter, document harvester and the user interface. Throughout the sprint, Trent worked on and finished the user interface. In this sprint, Reagan continued to work on the document harvester and the document tagger. Marisa worked on the formatting of the exporter. This includes updating the exporter to use the tag tree to create the final pdf and implementing set font sizes based on the tag type. In addition to these features, our team also created and presented a poster detailing our project, and finished the MVP Project Report. To create this documentation, our team used PowerPoint and Google Docs to collectively collaborate on the assignments and we have been creating branches on Github for each issue/feature and working on our individual features weekly.

## Retrospective Summary
Here's what went well:
  * We were better about getting assignments done earlier instead of starting them last minute
  * Worked well as a team to create and present our poster
 
Here's what we'd like to improve:
   * Making contributions by group members more even in the project
   * Adding test cases immediately after a feature is finished
 
Here are changes we plan to implement in the next sprint:
   * Combine our work together more frequently
