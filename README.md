# wsulibraries-accessibilityapps

## Project Summary


In accordance with and in shared pursuit of WSU's research exchange mission, we\
would like to help create a space designed to preserve and share university scholarship.\
Within a single and shared digital repository, not only do we want a limitless array of knowledge\
from articles, books, papers, and reports, but we want this digital media to be accessible to all.\
This starts, first, with these digital documents meeting the standards set out by W3C, an\
international community trying to bring public work together by providing concrete standards for\
websites and digital media.

Many digital works are brought to the research exchange repository lacking the initial\
accessibility standards for digital media set out by the international community, and has resulted\
in an unknown but copious amount of educational media with sub-optimal accessibility. Our\
goal is to create an application that can take a pdf and create a modified version that does not\
change the comprehension or meaning of the work but heightens that document's accessibility\
to that of W3C standards. We wish to then streamline this process, with it not just assisting a\
single document, but that of an entire repository, to make the entire WSU research exchange\
significantly more accessible to all.

### Brief Description
To create software that can transform documents in W3C accessible documents, allowing those with various\
disabilities equitable access to information.


### Additional Information 
In our quest to bring more accessibility to the WSU research exchange, we have landed on a few key accessibility\
features to focus on, at least at the start, which can be expanded to other things as our project progresses.\
These initial features include document metadata, color contrast, tagging, alternative text for images, and\
reading order. Our desire is to create a fully automated system of taking pdf documents and converting them\
into these more accessible versions.

## Installation

1. Clone Repo or download and extract through ZIP.
2. Run src code directly with *python accessibility_apps/terminal.application.py*
2. Run with no dependency perquisites with  *bin/terminal_application.exe*

### Prerequisites

* Latest Version of Python
* Pip install all modules through requirements.txt

### Add-ons

No Add ons.

### Installation Steps

1. Clone repo
2. Pip install -r requirements
3. python accessibility_apps/terminal.application.py


## Functionality

* Run terminal_application.py to run CLI or Executable in Bin
* (Terminal Option) Open a PDF for accessibility processing
* (Terminal Option) Run accessibility pipeline
* (Terminal Option) Export and download transformed document


## Known Problems

Many pipeline accessibility transformations are not operational at this time.
Importer and Exporter functionality is still WIP. Need to provide path between these three modular components.
