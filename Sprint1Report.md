## Work Summary (Developer Facing)
During this sprint our team was able to create the necessary documentation for our project. This documentation will inform readers about our team as well as our project and how we intend to implement our solution. To create this documentation, our team met weekly to collaborate on each document using Google Docs. During our meetings we would discuss the document as a group, get a general consensus on what each section of the document should detail, and then split the document up into three equal parts and assign one part per group member. While creating these documents our group would sometimes come across terms that none of us knew. In these cases, we would look at our notes from previous classes and Google the topics to gain an understanding on the topics we lacked knowledge on.
