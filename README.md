## Project summary

    In accordance with and in shared pursuit of WSU's research exchange mission, we\
would like to help create a space designed to preserve and share university scholarship.\
Within a single and shared digital repository, not only do we want a limitless array of knowledge\
from articles, books, papers, and reports, but we want this digital media to be accessible to all.\
This starts, first, with these digital documents meeting the standards set out by W3C, an\
international community trying to bring public work together by providing concrete standards for\
websites and digital media.

Many digital works are brought to the research exchange repository lacking the initial\
accessibility standards for digital media set out by the international community, and has resulted\
in an unknown but copious amount of educational media with sub-optimal accessibility. Our\
goal is to create an application that can take a pdf and create a modified version that does not\
change the comprehension or meaning of the work but heightens that document's accessibility\
to that of W3C standards. We wish to then streamline this process, with it not just assisting a\
single document, but that of an entire repository, to make the entire WSU research exchange\
significantly more accessible to all.\


### One-sentence description of the project

To create software that can transform documents in W3C accessible documents.

### Additional information about the project

    In our quest to bring more accessibility to the WSU research exchange, we have landed
on a few key accessibility features to focus on, at least at the start, which can be expanded to
other things as our project progresses. These initial features include document metadata, color
contrast, tagging, alternative text for images, and reading order. Our desire is to create a fully
automated system of taking pdf documents and converting them into these more accessible
versions.
